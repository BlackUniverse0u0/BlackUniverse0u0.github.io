  title={ReSTR: Convolution-free Referring Image Segmentation Using Transformers},
  author={Kim, Namyup and Kim, Dongwon and Lan, Cuiling and Zeng, Wenjun and Kwak, Suha},
  abstract={Referring image segmentation is an advanced semantic segmentation task where target is not a predefined class but is described in natural language. Most of existing methods for this task rely heavily on convolutional neural networks, which however have trouble capturing long-range dependencies between entities in the language expression and are not flexible enough for modeling interactions between the two different modalities. To address these issues, we present the first convolution-free model for referring image segmentation using transformers, dubbed ReSTR. Since it extracts features of both modalities through transformer encoders, it can capture long-range dependencies between entities within each modality. Also, ReSTR fuses features of the two modalities by a self-attention encoder, which enables flexible and adaptive interactions between the two modalities in the fusion process. The fused features are fed to a segmentation module, which works adaptively according to the image and language expression in hand. ReSTR is evaluated and compared with previous work on all public benchmarks, where it outperforms all existing models.},

  title={Urie: Universal image enhancement for visual recognition in the wild},
  author={Son, Taeyoung and Kang, Juwon and Kim, Namyup and Cho, Sunghyun and Kwak, Suha},
  abstract={Despite the great advances in visual recognition, it has been witnessed that recognition models trained on clean images of common datasets are not robust against distorted images in the real world. To tackle this issue, we present a Universal and Recognition-friendly Image Enhancement network, dubbed URIE, which is attached in front of existing recognition models and enhances distorted input to improve their performance without retraining them. URIE is universal in that it aims to handle various factors of image degradation and to be incorporated with any arbitrary recognition models. Also, it is recognition-friendly since it is optimized to improve the robustness of following recognition models, instead of perceptual quality of output image. Our experiments demonstrate that URIE can handle various and latent image distortions and improve the performance of existing models for five diverse recognition tasks when input images are degraded.},
